# Run Log — 2026-03-10

## Context
- Issue: backend persistence for org employee ordering in `/panel/grafik` scope.
- Actions: added sortOrder, new org endpoints, idempotency support, logging.

## Changes
- Added `Employee.sortOrder` nullable field and migration.
- Added `/api/org/employees` GET ordered listing and `/api/org/employees/order` PUT ordering.
- Implemented Redis-backed idempotency with in-memory fallback and request logging.

## Migrations
- Not run locally (manual migration file added): `backend-v2/prisma/migrations/20260310120000_add_employee_sort_order`.

## Commands Run (no secrets)
- `curl -i http://localhost:4000/api/org/employees`
- `curl -i -X PUT http://localhost:4000/api/org/employees/order -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Idempotency-Key: example-key" -d '{"orderedEmployeeIds":["00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"]}'`

## Notes
- Curl commands expect local backend running and will fail if the service is not started.
