## Summary
- Fixed grafik keyboard handling by introducing a focusable grid root with active-state tracking and centralized hotkey handling.
- Added aria-activedescendant/roving selection IDs and gridcell roles to support reliable keyboard navigation and focus.
- Updated Playwright grafik tests for grid focus, arrow navigation, clipboard hotkeys, and edit mode hold behavior.

## Root Cause
Hotkeys were bound to window with brittle selection gating and no focusable grid root, so key events never reached the handler when the grid was inactive or not focused.

## Tests
- npm run lint
- npm run build
- npm run test:e2e
