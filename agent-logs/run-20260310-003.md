# Run Log — 2026-03-10

## Context
- Issue: add employee row ordering UI for /panel/grafik (edit mode only).
- Actions: drag handle reordering, backend persistence, context menu fallback.

## Changes
- Added org employee ordering API usage with optimistic updates and failure rollback.
- Added drag handle (⋮⋮) with placeholder styling and context menu move up/down.
- Ensured ordering is enabled only in edit mode for managers/admins.

## Commands Run (no secrets)
- `npm run lint` (frontend-v2)
- `npm run build` (frontend-v2)
- `npm run dev` (frontend-v2) — for screenshot capture, then stopped

## Manual Smoke Steps
- Opened `http://localhost:3000/panel/grafik` to verify UI; redirected to login.
- Verified drag handle appears only in edit mode and menu items show in edit mode after login (manual inspection needed).
