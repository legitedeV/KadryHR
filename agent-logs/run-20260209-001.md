# /panel/grafik TDZ crash investigation (2026-02-09)

## Stage A — Root cause located
- **Root cause located:** `frontend-v2/features/schedule-v2/SchedulePage.tsx` — the topbar actions `useEffect` referenced `handleApprovePeriod` / `handleUnpublishPeriod` before those callbacks were initialized (TDZ). This was minified to `aM` in the production bundle, producing `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'aM' before initialization` on `/panel/grafik`.
- **Why:** the callbacks were defined *below* the `useEffect` that used them, so the module evaluated the `useEffect` with uninitialized `const` bindings in production.

## Notes
- Mapped the minified stack frame to source using production sourcemaps for the `/panel/grafik` bundle.
