# Run 20260206-001

## Summary
- Implemented safer employee row drag handling with handle-only DnD and a visual drop placeholder in grafik.

## Manual test steps
1. Log in as manager/admin and open /panel/grafik.
2. Enable Edit Mode and ensure drag handle (⋮⋮) appears for each employee row.
3. Drag a row by the handle and verify the dashed placeholder appears; drop to reorder and confirm the row order changes.
4. Use the handle context menu to select "Przenieś w górę" / "Przenieś w dół" and confirm ordering changes.
5. Log in as a non-manager and verify the handle/context menu do not appear and rows cannot be reordered.

## Notes
- No secrets or sensitive data included.
