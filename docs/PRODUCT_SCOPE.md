# KadryHR — Product Scope

## What KadryHR is
- A focused operational workspace for everyday planning.
- A calm control surface for scheduling (Grafik) and availability (Dyspozycje).
- A single place to review key operational signals (Dashboard) and manage personal settings (Profil).

## What KadryHR is not
- Not a full HR suite.
- Not payroll, contracts, documents, or compliance tooling.
- Not a notification center, audit console, or admin back-office.
- Not a marketing site or lead management system.

## Why only four modules exist
KadryHR exists to make daily operations effortless. Keeping only the four core modules removes noise,
reduces cognitive load, and keeps the product fast, predictable, and premium in feel.

## Focus statement
KadryHR is focused on planning, availability, and execution — nothing more.
