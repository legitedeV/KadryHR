# Feature Parity Matrix — KadryHR vs Kadromierz vs GIR Staff

| Feature Area | KadryHR current | Kadromierz | GIR Staff | Gap | Implementation plan | Backend items | Frontend items | Acceptance tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time & Attendance (RCP) | Missing clock events, no geofence/device rules | Clock-in/out with PIN/QR, location/device control, tardiness flags | Mobile-first clocking, offline queue, GPS verification | Full module absent | Add attendance events, device/location allowlists, audit log, offline queue | Prisma models for time events & audit, endpoints for start/stop/break, fraud flags, RBAC; notifications hooks | Mobile-ready clock widget with QR/PIN, break buttons, offline cache + sync banner, admin settings | Clock in/out works online/offline; break tracked; events rejected outside geofence; audit record created |
| Scheduling (Grafik) | Basic shift CRUD, no templates/swaps/conflict rules | Templates, recurring patterns, compliance warnings, swap approvals | Self-service swap/claim, multi-location views | Templates, recurrence, swaps, compliance validation missing | Add shift templates, copy week, rules engine, swap marketplace with approvals | Prisma models for templates/swaps, validation service (rest periods/overlaps), swap endpoints & audit | UI for templates, copy week, conflict warnings, employee swap/claim flow with approvals | Creating template applies to week; swap request changes assignee after approval; compliance warnings shown on violation |
| Absences / Leave | Not implemented; requests page uses availability proxy | Full leave types, approvals, balances, calendar block | Request/approve leave, attachments, mobile view | No real leave workflow, no balances | Implement leave requests workflow first (this delivery), balances later | LeaveRequest model, CRUD + approval endpoints, balance scaffolding, notifications | Leave list/create/approve UI, calendar overlay, employee self-service | Employee submits leave, manager approves/rejects with note, status reflected on list |
| Notifications | None | Email/app alerts for shifts/requests | Mobile push + inbox | No notification infra | Add notification service + preferences | Notification tables, triggers for shifts/requests, email adapter stub | In-app inbox, per-type settings, badge counters | Trigger sends in-app record; preference toggles respected |
| Reports & Exports | Missing | Attendance/absence/overtime exports | CSV/XLS schedule/attendance exports | Reporting/export absent | Add reporting endpoints and CSV/XLS exports | Aggregation endpoints (attendance, absences), export profiles, payroll-ready formatter | Reports UI with filters/date range, download buttons | Export generates CSV/XLS matching filter; totals match on-screen data |
| Integrations (Payroll) | None | Payroll exports (PL vendors) | Import/export staff data | No integration layer | Define export profile abstraction + one working profile | Export profile model/service, mapper for payroll fields, webhook hooks | Settings UI to configure profile and run export | Running export produces valid file and audit entry |
| Employee Mobile / PWA | Responsive panel, no PWA install or mobile RCP | Mobile apps + push | Mobile-first app with clock/schedule/leave | Missing mobile-first flows/offline | Make panel PWA-capable, offline hints, compact nav | Add manifest/service worker, offline cache policy | Mobile nav for schedule/clock/leave, install prompt, skeletons | PWA installable; core flows usable on mobile viewport/offline retry |
